### Summary
I have never done automation for API testing before, so I had to do some research and learn a few new things to complete this exercise. 
I decided to use JavaScript for writing the test scripts and chose the Supertest library for making requests, Chai library for easy assertions and the Mocha framework for running the test scripts.

### Scenario 1
```
Design test cases for the Petstore based on Swagger specification (https://petstore.swagger.io/).
There is a template for the API test case design below, but the candidate is free to use any format.
The test design will be submitted together with the code.
```

### Scenario 2
```
Implement the tests designed in Exercise 2 - Scenario 1
● Please assume that the API is an actual Pet Store API. 
● The candidate can use any programming language. However, extra credit will be given if Typescript is used.
● Submit your code on either Github or Google Drive 

Minimum Scenarios to be implemented 
1. Buyer can check available pets named “pupo” with category name “pajaro” and place an order for a pet 
2. Store owner can update the pet information of pets named “kurikuri” under category “Pomeranian” to add the tag “Super Cute”
