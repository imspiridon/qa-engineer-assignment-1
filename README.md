### Summary
I have never done automation for API testing before, so I had to do some research and learn a few new things to complete this exercise. 
I decided to use JavaScript for writing the test scripts and chose the Supertest library for making requests, Chai library for easy assertions and the Mocha framework for running the test scripts.
